### Hi, I'm Matthew Burke
I'm a machine learning engineer who is interested in a lot of things like generative art (check me out [on instagram](https://instagram.com/mwburke])) and game development. I have a blog at mwburke.github.io where I write about them sometimes.

#### A few things I have made

- [PyMC Wrapper](https://github.com/mwburke/pymc-wrapper): a wrapper utility to make PyMC models simpler and quicker to deploy with accompanying [blog post](https://mwburke.github.io/data%20science/2023/02/23/pymc-wrapper.html)
- [RLevator](https://github.com/mwburke/RLevator): an in-progress [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) (successor to OpenAI Gym) environment to model elevator control
- [Codenames Clue Generator](https://github.com/mwburke/codenames-clue-generator): tool to generate clue ideas for the game [Codenames](https://codenames.game/) using semantic similarity with accompanying [blog post](https://mwburke.github.io/data%20science/2021/12/12/codenames-clue-generator-version-1.html)
- [Multi-Armed Bandits Exploration](https://github.com/mwburke/bandits):  exploration of several methods to learn in a MAB environment and accompanying [blog post](https://mwburke.github.io/data%20science/2019/06/18/bandits-exploration.html) with UCB visualization![](https://mwburke.github.io/images/ucb_race_gif.gif)
- [Stargazer](https://github.com/mwburke/stargazer): simple python port of the R stargazer regression results formatting tool
- [Pure Python XGBoost Prediction Library](https://github.com/mwburke/xgboost-python-deploy): a dependency free way to run XGBoost predictions using pure python
